This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(diamonds)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
names(diamonds)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
dm <- diamonds

levels(dm$cut)

subset(dm, dm$carat >= 5.01)

?diamonds

?hist

hist(dm$price, breaks=250, xlim=range(500))

summary(dm$price)

under500 <- subset(dm, dm$price < 500)$price
under250 <- subset(dm, dm$price < 250)$price
above15000 <- subset(dm, dm$price >= 15000)$price

library(ggplot2)

qplot(x=price, data=dm, binwidth=1) +
  scale_x_continuous(lim=c(0,2000), breaks=seq(0, 2000, 100))
ggsave("priceHistBin1.png")

#break down the price histo by cut
qplot(x=price, data=dm) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  facet_wrap(~cut, ncol = 2)

qplot(x=cut, y=price, data=dm, geom="boxplot") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(325,327))

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) + facet_wrap(~cut, scales = "free_y")

?facet_wrap

# Create a histogram of price per carat
# and facet it by cut. You can make adjustments
# to the code from the previous exercise to get
# started.

# Adjust the bin width and transform the scale
# of the x-axis using log10.

# Submit your final code when you are ready.

# ENTER YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE.
# ===========================================================================

qplot(x = price, data = dm, binwidth=0.01) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~cut, scales = "free_y")


# Investigate the price of diamonds using box plots,
# numerical summaries, and one of the following categorical
# variables: cut, clarity, or color.

# There wonâ€™t be a solution video for this
# exercise so go to the discussion thread for either
# BOXPLOTS BY CLARITY, BOXPLOT BY COLOR, or BOXPLOTS BY CUT
# to share you thoughts and to
# see what other people found.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Copy and paste all of the code that you used for
# your investigation, and submit it when you are ready.
